        The purpose of the Online The Waste Reduction Directory is to provide Corvallis
        and the outlying community a convenient and accessible way to easily locate businesses or organizations that
        will either accept reusable items for resale or donation to the public or offer repair services.
        The Online Directory allows the public to search items or categories and then click and go to a list of
        businesses that take items that can be reused, recycled, or repaired. The Online Directory provides a map
        showing where the businesses are located and their webpage if there is one, phone number, address, and hours
        of operation. In addition to providing information on where to take reusable and repairable items
        the Online Directory will have a link to a website that gives the community up to date information
        on recycling opportunities.
